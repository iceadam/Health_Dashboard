# Health_Dashboard
This project is a dashboard for monitoring a medical patient's vital signs. It includes a real-time simulation of a publisher/subscriber system, developed using Wokwi, to demonstrate data flow from sensors to the dashboard. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and it communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve patient data.

## Features

*   Real-time monitoring of patient's vital signs.
*   Simulation of a pub/sub system for data transmission.
*   User-friendly interface to visualize patient data.
*   Backend server to handle data and requests.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Simulation:** Wokwi
*   **Other Tools:** body-parser, cors

## Usage

Once the server is running, open `index.html` in your web browser to view the dashboard. The dashboard will display the patient's vital signs, which are updated in real time through the Wokwi simulation.
