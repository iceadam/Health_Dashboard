# Health_Dashboard
This project is a dashboard for monitoring a medical patient's vital signs. It includes a real-time simulation of a publisher/subscriber system, developed using Wokwi, to demonstrate data flow from sensors to the dashboard. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and it communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve patient data.
